    <p>Toilet paper, while widely used throughout the world, does not come with instructions upon purchase. This documentation will attempt to fill the gap and covers all major brands on the market today.</p>

      What You Should Already Know
    </header>
    <p>It's important to understand these concepts prior to unwrapping your toilet paper:</p>
    <p><ul>
    <li>You are going to poop and/or pee at some point</li>
    <li>You will need to wipe your personal area(s) clean before dressing</li>
    <li>Where you keep your toilet</li>
    <li>Where to find your personal area(s)</li>
    <li>How to unwrap packaging</li></ul>

      Packaging
    </header>
    <p>Toilet paper is typically sold in plastic wrapping of some kind. This is to prevent moisture from ruining the paper before it is used. You will need to remove the plastic wrapping to access the individual rolls. Some brands will have the rolls individually contained in an outer paper wrapping. If this is the case with your brand, you will need to remove this as well.</p>
    <p>Once the outer wrappings are removed, you are at the usable portion of your toilet paper roll. <em>Do not unravel the paper.</em> This is the actual paper you will use to clean your personal area(s). It must remain intact on the cardboard roll in order to function properly.</p>

    <header>The Holder
    </header>
    <p>In close proximity to your toilet, you will likely find the appliance that will hold the roll of toilet paper. It is usually metal and is typically a small concave shape embedded into the wall. There should be a plastic, wood or metal cylinder set into the middle of the holder.</p>
    <p>This is where you will install your toilet paper roll and keep it ready for use.</p>
    <p>If you do not have or cannot find the holder, you can skip to the section Using the Paper for direction on application sans holder.</p>

    <p>Grasp the middle cylinder with two hands, and push together. The two ends will pop out of the holder edges and the cylinder will be free. Use caution to avoid dropping the cylinder into the toilet.</p>
    <p>With the toilet paper roll in one hand, slide it over the cylinder. Then, holding the ends of the cylinder, push one end into a holder edge. Pushing on the free cylinder end, pop it into the opposite edge of the holder.</p>
    <p>The toilet paper should now be able to freely rotate around the cylinder. </p>
    <p id="note">Note: The roll should be positioned so that the paper itself will come over the top of the roll, rather than underneath. The other way is illegal and will be met with severe punishment. If you find the roll in the wrong position, simply turn it over using the procedure outlined above. You have approximately 30 seconds before the authorities arrive.</p>

      <p>Once you have relieved yourself, grasp the toilet paper and gently pull on the roll. When you have an adequate amount* for the amount of wiping you will need to do, tear sideways to rip the paper from the rest of the roll. Note that while the paper is technically broken and no longer intact, this is the functional purpose of the roll. It does not require repair.</p>
      <p>With the broken off piece of paper in hand, gently clean the appropriate area(s).</p>
      <p>You may also be in need of clearing your nasal passages. This is also an accepted use for the toilet paper. However, use caution in that the order of application is 1) Nose, and 2) Personal area(s). Reverse the order at your own risk.</p>
      <p>Once you have cleaned your personal areas, simply deposit the used paper into the toilet. It is not necessary to keep the paper for later use. It cannot be washed and should not be reused or stored in any other container.</p>
      <p id="note">*An adequate amount depends largely on individual preference and state of personal area(s). Note that one square is never an adequate amount and half a roll is too much.</p>
